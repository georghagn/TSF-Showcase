# Contributing to Tsf Framework

First of all: Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the TSF Framework! Open source thrives on people like you.

This document contains guidelines designed to ensure that the project remains maintainable and stable for everyone.

## 1. How do I report bugs?

Before creating an issue:
* Please check if the problem has already been reported.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of the framework.

When creating an issue, please provide us with as much information as possible:
* Which version are you using?
* Steps to reproduce the bug.
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* (Optional) A minimal code example.

## 2. Pull Requests (Contributing Code)

We welcome pull requests (PRs). To ensure your PR is merged quickly, please note the following:

1. **Fork & Branch:** Create a fork and work in a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
2. **Coding Style:** Adhere to the existing code style of the framework.
3. **Tests:** When adding new functionality, please write corresponding tests. When fixing a bug, include a regression test.
4. **License Header:** Please ensure that new files contain the correct SPDX license header:
`// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

## 3. Legal & Licensing

By submitting a pull request, you confirm that:
1. You are the author of the code or have the rights to contribute it.
2. You agree that your contribution will be released under the **Apache License 2.0** (just like this project).

We operate on the principle of "inbound = outbound." This means we do not require a separate Contributor License Agreement (CLA) as long as you confirm that your contribution is under the project license.
